Homework Assigment Lab 8 hours.

In this POC I execuet the following tasks:

- Jenkins Project Setup
        - Create a persistent Jenkins
        - Create a custom agent image (which includes skopeo) to build the pipeline

- Pipeline
        - Create a Jenkins pipeline for the Tasks application and store it in the source code repository
        - The pipeline executes the following steps:
            - Build the source code, using the shared Nexus as a Maven proxy cache
            - Execute the following tests in parallel:
                - Unit tests
                - Code coverage tests using the shared SonarQube instance
            - Tag the image with the version from the pom.xml and build number
            - Upload the generated artifact to the shared Nexus artifact repository
            - Upload the tested container image to the shared Nexus container registry
        - Deploy the application into the development project
        - Tags the image as version for production deployment
        - Deploys the application into the production project using a blue-green strategy
